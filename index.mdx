## Mission

The AI landscape is rapidly evolving from isolated models to interconnected agent ecosystems. Yet, without standardized protocols, these agents operate in silos—unable to discover, communicate, or collaborate effectively across platforms.

**Intra solves this** by building on top of Google's A2A protocol, creating an open registry where agents can:
- ✅ Register their capabilities
- ✅ Discover other agents
- ✅ Orchestrate complex workflows
- ✅ Operate securely and reliably

## Vision

We envision a future where AI agents operate as autonomous, interoperable services—just like microservices revolutionized web applications. By building on open standards like A2A and AP2, we're creating the infrastructure layer that makes this possible.
